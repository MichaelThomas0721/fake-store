# Sneak Easy (Mock E-Commerce)

This is a mock e-commerce store with stripe implementation using the Nuxtjs (Vue) framework.

Stripe has a list of fake credit cards to use (DO NOT use your real credit card) that will validate.
Example: Visa, 4242424242424242, 123 (any 3 numbers), 12/32 (any future date)
